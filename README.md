# Into the Woods
> A game about a quest from the office to the woods

You reach your third decade working in your office job, and you can't do it anymore. So, you leave everything and everyone you know and enter the wilderness...

## Overview

Into the Woods is an open-world tile-based game, where spending enough time in the woods means winning the game. See the WIP [design doc](DESIGN.md) for more info.

## Installation

There are currently no releases of the game, as it is in very early development.
